# project4_connorcole
 project 4 for CSCI-2910; using a web api
 blood sweat and tears has gone into this but i'm starting to enjoy it and understand it.


 
## Issues
  - Implementing the rest of the program

## Fixed issues
  - literally just making the data models and making sure they work
  - DATA MODELS ARE UNTESTED!!!!!!
    - Data models do not work
  - no clue if API will actually call and return good data
  - Need to get bundle info...

## Notes
  - after blood, sweat, and tears, i figured it out. fucking nested dictionaries. that's why it wouldn't work- it was already a dictionary of dictionaries. (2:43 PM, 9/24/24)
  - API calls all work, data is good and is always validated, no issues currently. just need to implement rest of program (1:25 PM, 9/25/2024)
