# project4_connorcole
 project 4 for CSCI-2910; using a web api

 im not even gonna lie i started this while working on the documentation and got like 30 minutes deep making the model for the data before i remembered to make a repo. this shit is all hand typed i had to take a walk around campus at 11:00 at NIGHT on a thursday evening to figure it out


 
## Issues
  - Implementing the rest of the program

## Fixed issues
  - literally just making the data models and making sure they work
  - DATA MODELS ARE UNTESTED!!!!!!
    - Data models do not work
  - no clue if API will actually call and return good data

## Notes
  - the data model was made over the span of like an hour (and remains untested)
  - i am not adding more data models than just AGENTS. this has too many damn attributes for each thing. i dont want to do any more (11:49 PM, 9/19/24)
  -i am done for the night (11:50 PM, 9/19/24)
  - after blood, sweat, and tears, i figured it out. fucking nested dictionaries. that's why it wouldn't work- it was already a dictionary of dictionaries. (2:43 PM, 9/24/24)
